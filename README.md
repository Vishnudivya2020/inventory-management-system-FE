*ABOUT PROJECT:
        My project, 'Inventory Management System,' requires users to register or log in before entering the home page. On the registration page, I set it up to collect user details and assign roles as either 'User' or 'Admin.' If someone registers as an Admin, a new input box appears where they must enter a secret key. For the User role, no extra steps are required. If you log in as an Admin, you are authorized to view the Product page and can delete, edit, and add new products, as well as perform these actions on other pages. However, if you log in as a User, you are unauthorized to access the Product page, but you can still view all other pages.

  *ADMIN  SECRET KEY :  
            =>  IMS
